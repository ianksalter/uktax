#' The Personal Allowance Class
#'
#' This class describes the personal allowance that a person has in the UK tax system.
#' In the UK the personal allowance is how much you can earn tax free. However the allowance is 
#' withdrawn at the give rate over the threshold
#' Note this is a simplification of the actual UK tax system.
#' @field allowance The amount of the allowance.
#' @field threshold The income at which the allowance starts to be withdrawn
#' @field rate The rate at which the allowance is withdrawn.
